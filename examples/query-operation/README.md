# Overview

// This example demonstrates how to use the PostgreSQL client select query operations with the stream return type.

# Prerequisite

* Install the PostgreSQL server and create a database 

* Add required configurations in the `config.toml` file 

* Follow one of the following ways to add PostgreSQL database driver JAR in the `Ballerina.toml` file:
    * Download the JAR and update the path
        ```
        [[platform.java17.dependency]]
        path = "PATH"
        ```
     
    * Replace the above path with a maven dependency param
       ```
       [platform.java17.dependency]]
       groupId = "org.postgresql"
       artifactId = "postgresql"
       version = "42.2.20"
       ```
# Run the example
 
To run the example, move into the `query-operation` project and execute the below command.
 
```
$bal run
```
It will build the `query-operation` Ballerina project and then run it.

# Output of the example

This gives the following output when running this project.

```ballerina
