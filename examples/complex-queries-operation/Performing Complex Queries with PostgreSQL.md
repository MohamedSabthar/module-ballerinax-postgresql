# Overview

This example demonstrates how to use the PostgreSQL client with complex data types such as JSON, range and date/time fields.

# Prerequisite

* Install the PostgreSQL server and create a database 

* Add required configurations in the `Config.toml` file 

# Run the example
 
To run the example, move into the `complex-queries-operation` project and execute the below command.

```shell
bal run
```
It will build the `complex-queries-operation` Ballerina project and then run it.

# Output of the example

This gives the following output when running this project.

```shell
Json types Result :
{"row_id":1,"json_type":{"key1":"value","key2":2},"jsonb_type":{"key1":"value","key2":2},"jsonpath_type":"$."floor"[*]."apt"[*]?(@."area" > 40 && @."area" < 90)?(@."rooms" > 1)"}
